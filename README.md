# Read Data From YouTube Comment Suite
[Youtube-comment-suite](https://github.com/mattwright324/youtube-comment-suite) is a powerful tool for collecting data related to YouTube channels, accounts, and networks of accounts. 
To make the most of the data which youtube-comment-suite collects I've fashoned this simple notebook which reads the commentsuite.sqlite3 file into pandas for additional analysis, filtering, and visualization. 
This was used in an upcoming article detailing a deepfake-crypto-livestream-scam on YouTube.
